# ads4mo - Added Download services for Mercator-Ocean

Python module containing added downloads services for downloading the netCDF files from the CMEMS's product catalogue. It is possible  download data by MOTHs, DEPTHs or DAYS until a maximum of three variables selected (Planning to increase this number thought). It brings in a very intuitive scripting way what was already proposed with [MerOC]().

## Be aware that:

The tool is in development so it can be possible find bugs, errors and imprecisions. Please to report them if you find one.

## Dependencies:

The dependencies required which are not installed by default are listed below:

- [x] motuclient>=1.8.1
- [x] ftputil>=3.4

## Installation and module usage

```
pip install das4mo
```
we can import the module as:

```
from das4mo import download
```
Once the module is imported we can call the interactive download process typing;

```
download()
```
At this point the system is going to ask;

- **Type of the download** which can be set typing one of the following:

     - **MONTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by months
     - **DEPTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by the depths level
     - **DAY**: The entire period selected will download in a daily base 

- **Motu client script** which is generated by the CMEMS web portal. Please to copy and paste (or if you prefer typing by hand) just from the "--user" to the "--variable" parameters and replace <USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> with your CMEMS credentials. Following an example:

```
python <PATH_TO_MOTUCLIENT_DIR>/motu-client.py --user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD> --motu http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --date-max "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT  --out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME>
```

What you need to make the module works:

```
--user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD> --motu http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --date-max "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT
```
